            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <h4>Q: Why are you getting married on a Thursday?</h4>
            <p>A:Our boyfriend/girlfriend anniversary is June 8. We've always known that's the date we also want to get married. It just so happened to fall on a Thursday this year. We're celebrating our 13th year together this year!</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Q: What should I wear?</h4>
            <p>A: Outdoor Formal/Cocktail. We want everyone to be comfortable so please don't stress too much about what to wear. We want your presence there, most of all. There will be a mixture of wooden deck, grass, indoor flooring and lots and lots of dancing so please make sure you wear comfortable shoes! Please also feel free to wear Barong/Filipiniana. For those asking, we have a very flexible palette of (natural) greens, if you want to stick to the theme. Here's a handy-dandy <a href="mood-board.png" download>mood board</a> if that sort of thing is helpful to you.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Q: Where are you registered for gifts?</h4>
            <p>A: We honestly have everything we need for our home and just want to celebrate our union with you but if you would like to contribute to our honeymoon/savings fund, we would really appreciate it! You can write a check to Illee Ipanag or Aldene Villardo or Zelle/Venmo us.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Q: Can I bring additional guests?</h4>
            <p>A: Unfortunately, as much as we want to invite all the people in our lives, the venue can only accommodate a finite number of guests so, no, sorry.</p>
